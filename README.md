# Capstone-Reviews

To use this code, you will need a data source. I use a Qualtrics survey to retrieve data and use the .csv to read data into the program. 
  For user ease, I have included a sample data file and sample pdfs that should be greated after a successful run.
After downloading your .csv, you will need to change your delimiter to "#" so that the code runs correctly. Re-save the .csv file so that the delimiter is change.
  However, be sure that your .csv does not contain "#" anywhere in the .csv text
To use the program, download it and unzip the file. I use NetBeans, so then open the project in NetBeans.
Change the path for the location of the .csv file so that it can be found by the program, and change the path of the folder that will save the pdfs on your computer
build and run the file
