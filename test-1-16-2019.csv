Whether this be reminding the group of goals we have set out to reach, being proactive in starting new projects, or documenting what is going on I feel that I am bringing value by keeping the group together and not eliminating division. #I can improve on the logistics of understanding the project. I have not had any experience with working with servers or LAMP and I feel like I am playing catchup. However, I have been watching Web developments / PHP basics online and am trying to educate myself to where I feel my team is. In addition, I am working on speaking up and with authority. There has been a few times this semester where my ideas have been right and it is not decided untill someone brings it up 30 minutes later. I need to better explain myself / present myself in a better way. #During the next month - I am going to focus more time on PDP and apply to numerous jobs.

I understand we are college students and working in a group - not a business setting but I do not think some of the conversations are meant to be had in a business like manner. I did mention it to her - and since then their has not be issues so i appreciate that. #Good overall worker#Alexander Coury#Very Good#Very Good#Satisfactory#Excellent#Very Good#One of Alex's strength is his knowledge in this industry and what is going on. There has been numerous times where Jake was in a struggle and he came out of what he was doing and knew how to solve the answer. I am impressed with his knowledge and what all he is capable of bringing to the team. In addition, I appreciate his organization with what he has on the board as agendas for the days. Alex, has been a great team lead and I feel like he has not created any division in our team. I also appreciate how he is trying to help people grow in the industry they want to grow in. For example he will assign people certain task based off their preferences. #One of the things I believe Alex can grow in, is showing leadership skills in all areas of the group. There has been a few occasions where I feel as if he has zoned out and he does not take my input into considerations, and it makes me feel undervalued / not respected. I do not want to accuse him of this because I do not think he is doing it on purpose, rather he is just focusing on the task on hand. However, I wish we communicated better than we do. #I am happy he is our team lead. #Michael McKinney#Excellent#Excellent#Excellent#Excellent#Excellent#I can honestly say Merrit, this past month has been one of the best group members I have worked with in MIS. The way he presents himself, the way he keeps personal stuff out in certain situations, and the way he can analyze situations all impress me. Merrit, was someone I asked 1 on 1 about what he thought I could do to bring more value to the team.  I mention, I felt undervalued and not appreciated two weeks ago and he responded with no everything we have done you have asked to do, and you have not cause the group any troubles - curious to why I was thinking this. He said Alex, was trying to allocate jobs to certain people based off of want they want to do and since talking to him (whether he kept it private or public) I have been assigned more task - and have felt  more valued. I really appreciate him as a person - and as a team member. I hope to work on more goals with him this semester as I feel I can learn alot from him. #Just continue to present himself the way he does. I really enjoyed meeting with him this semester and I hope I can learn off of him in being a great leader. #I believe he is the base of our team - through his voice and his knowledge. #Jacob Gillham#Very Good#Satisfactory#Excellent#Very Good#Very Good#Jakes strength is the ability to take on a challenge and work on completing a task. He took on the task of learning about the server and how to operate on it. I am impressed with his dedication to it and the time he spends researching and understanding the operating system. In addition, Jake is a very open guy. I have had many conversations with him this semester just about how we view certain situations and how we can better ourselves. I feel like as a person, he is making me better in being honest in hard situations. I very much respect his opinion and hope to see him as a tech lead to develop over the semester. #Because jake has been sick for a week, and his limited some of his time working in the capstone group, I am unaware of how he evaluates certain decisions. I trust what he is doing but I do not know how much preparation has gone into the decision making. This is mainly due to the fact I have not worked with him but I believe he will continue to grow on me and show he is well rounded in all aspects of MIS.#Jake was sick for a week - which has limited our time together. However, I really appreciate working with him and the way he goes about life. I enjoy our conversations and I believe we are making improvements in personal growth.#John Halpin#Satisfactory#Very Good#Fair#Poor#Very Good#Jack has been one of the hardest working group members we have - he is always working on the project / researching what is going on. I feel like he has a great grasp of where the project is going and what needs to be accomplished in the group. Jack and I have gotten along great this semester and I enjoy being on his team. Being on this project last year, I think has put him in an advantage and when he mentions something about the project - I will re-evaluate my thoughts no matter what I think. I respect Jack, and I am happy he is in our group. #One of the areas Jack can improve on is his communication. When jack tries to present ideas I believe he is not very confident in presenting them. I think Jack has a great understanding of what is suppose to go on but him not presenting it very strong makes you not believe him as much. I think jack will be a great team member if he can state his ideas firmly. In addition, I have not seen him perform much technical work but that is because the project is young. He is a double major so I know he is very capable but I have not seen it based off of where we are in this project. I expect it to be #"I consider Jack a good friend - and am happy he is my team member.

Tyler does not carry an equal amount of weight as I and the rest of his teammates when it comes to completing task. He will not even communicate and give a reason for not doing his share of the work, the task will just get completed by the team without any of his contribution. Even when I assign specific parts to each member, his work seems to be just good enough to get by compared to the rest of team.

I have insider information within our client of how they operate to better understand how to approach their problem because of my summer internship with them as well as a full time offer. I'm the one people go for guidance/advice and feedback on specific things they are working on.#"Communication skills. Meaning improving my ability to communicate my ideas and opinions especially when talking to a client. Guiding meetings and having more organic conversations with the client as well needs to be improved. 
Another area would be my ability to estimate a timeline of what we can get done. I definitely thought we can get things done in less time than it actually takes and I wasn't accounting for variable things to occur.

Also he can improve on adding more input in client meetings because I know he has things he wants to say.#Very easy to work with team member in terms of getting his parts done as well as willing to do more and looking to do more for the team.#Bailee Braun#Poor#Very Good#Very Good#Very Good#Very Good#There are always a few conversations we have about the scope and requirements that take us down a rabbit hole and are just un productive and brings the focus back and reminds us that it's agile and we don't have to waste time talking about certain unimportant things. Another strength would be her organization balancing the clients, multiple stakeholders and organizing all of the documentation. #Communication skills in terms of client meetings, taking more control over the meeting and the direction of the meeting. There definitely room to improve on technical skill and there will be many opportunities for that in the project, but I don't think this is that important because as a team lead there are many other responsibilities she has to worry about so it's not a disadvantage that she is the least technical.#Best fit to be a team lead out of everybody on our team.#Alec Lankford#Satisfactory#Excellent#Satisfactory#Excellent#Very Good#Very good at playing the devils advocate. So always asks what if this, what if this which makes it so our team doesn't miss little details. He also took the advanced programming class so he also has knowledge about the architecture we are using for this project which is very valuable for this technical project.#"He has to keep in mind that this project is primarily an agile approach which means there are things and topics that we don't have to worry about at this moment. This leads to good conversations and good to think about, but the level of effort and thought put in to this these should be left for a later stage and that energy should be put to something else. 
When doing tasks he asks a whole lot of questions on how to do it, very detail oriented questions so I would say an area of growth would be to make and trust your decisions on the spot and go with it."#Works really hard on certain things when given the task and doesn't just try to come in for the hours, he actually wants to put as much work in on the project as he can.#Julia Lorch#Very Good#Very Good#Satisfactory#Very Good#Very Good#"She is able to explain herself very well when giving ideas and backing ideas.

She has done a good job of creating a work environment that is productive but not stressful. She also does a great job at receiveing feedback and taking steps to improve.#We have already discussed this as a group, but because Laurel is so passionate about delivering a great product to our client, she can tend to try and manage every detail of the project.

She could take sometime each week to read through documentation of the software and coding languages that we are using to develop the app. This could lead to more accurate BA work.

At times we had work sessions where he wouldn't even show up without explanation, so he also needs to work on his communication. Or he'd leave very early with no reason or acknowledgment of him leaving. He has fallen very behind the rest of the team due to not being present and is now trying to play catch up on the training exercise. #Alex is now stepping up, so I hope this participation will turn around and he will realize that he needs to be present so that he can learn the environment and help the rest of the team out instead of negatively affecting us. #Holland Cox#Very Good#Poor#Poor#Very Good#Very Good#Holland is always present at work sessions unless there are reasons otherwise.

She is very kind and stays very positive even if she is frustrated. #Her technical skills could use growth due to the learning curve of learning a new environment, so she could definitely understand it better. #I really love having Holland as a teammate because she is a true team player and always wants to help any way she can. #74#12#K2#Ethan Anderson#James Shelander#Sam Cannon#Alex Lee#5#Holland Cox#x#Gary Spurrier#AIME117#

Ben, Craig, and Bao have a really strong workplace chemistry and sometimes it's difficult or even unnecessary to chime in because they are so on top of it. It leaves me somewhat insecure that I'm not contributing enough, however, most of the work we've done so far has been clerical. I think I will be able to be a much stronger team member when we get more into the development aspect of the project since that's more where my strengths are within our group.
"#As a team, we've gotten off to a somewhat slow start due to the learning curve of Ext JS and Git.

Ben is also really good about listening to input from the entire team.#Sometimes I feel like we encounter minor communication issues in our client meetings between the team and Teri and Scott. For example, the clients didn't realize we held our meetings in a separate conference room away from our machines until the third client meeting. That seemed to have been a big point of confusion for the clients in the first two meetings. Not a huge deal, but it would probably help reduce frustration on the client's end if Ben and the rest of us tried to go out of our way to clarify with them as much as possible. It's definitely more of a team-wide area we could all improve#n/a#Asanti McRae#Fair#Fair#Fair#Fair#Fair#"Asanti has a great personality and often has exciting ideas to contribute. 
"#To be fair, Asanti has experienced some technical issues with her machine that LabMX has not been able to resolve yet, so she might not have been able to contribute as much as the rest of the team.

I can grow in this fashion.#My schedule has a larger number of conflicts, which are completely out of my control, with the group schedule. By no means is it severe, but it is noteworthy and consistently keeps my hours 1-2 below my group members.#Kris Pennington#Excellent#Very Good#Satisfactory#Very Good#Very Good#Kris has an ability to be diligent in her contributions to the group, most recently in creating a custom mock app in powerapps, which provided the group with an initial understanding and ability to use powerapps. In power apps, she is ahead of the group. This is incredibly helpful for her to be a teacher in these early stages.#Kris leads by her actions rather than her words. The opportunity to take initiative, voice her opinions, and lead vocally is there.#Only girl on the group so she has to put up with us. Way to go#Brice Milam#Very Good#Very Good#Very Good#Excellent#Excellent#Brice has done a great job as team lead. He balances the role as team leader and team member well, and I feel comfortable looking to him for guidance for the group, while not feeling over powered, patronized, or belittled. He is very reasonable in his expectations and does not domineer other people with unrealistic expectations out of a need for control.  I also think that if the group were to lag behind, which we haven't, Brice would be a driving factor to motivate us.#In times of lack of direction, which we've experienced early in the project, Brice could grow in his vocally providing direction to each individual member. Essentially, delegation.#atta boy#Connor Reece#Very Good#Very Good#Very Good#Excellent#Very Good#First, Connor's attitude in being our team tech lead has been helpful and encouraging. He is readily willing to support us in our technical difficulties by putting in requests and taking some level of supportive responsibility. Connor has also been steady in his productivity for the group. We worked together on the initial stages of the app development and he was easy going, yet helpful and knowledgeable.#I cannot currently identify any. I'll keep an eye out. #Easy to work with. #Matthew Cutler#Very Good#Very Good#Very Good#Excellent#Very Good#Matt's effort and energy shined most in his willingness to do deep research into html and NET.Core technology and development. It was an unattractive option to do custom development this way, but nonetheless Matt was willing to dive in head first to take the lead on gaining understanding, which would have made him quite the technologically savvy leader had we gone in that direction. He is also easy to work with and has an amiable energy with the client. One that excites her, and puts her at easy. #Matt is thinking a lot and thinking valuable things. I hope that he can voice these opinions for the betterment of the group. That way we can process his valuable thoughts with him, rather than 1 person processing them alone.#Go matt!#William Swartz#Very Good#Very Good#Satisfactory#Poor#Very Good#Will has a desire to be organized and goal-oriented. This helps the group run well if we are lacking direction or need delegation. He senses when there is a need for delegation and organization. We is also very thorough, which is good, although it can occasionally be a weakness. Will will always get the job done when he is asked to do it--a responsible guy.#Will's desire to be thorough is good, but can occasionally be unnecessary. If we are asked to research a topic, then creating a word document with details of findings is good, theoretically, but in actuality it may be a waste of time because he could simply turn his chair around and vocally report to the group since we are small. Also, I think has a fairly good handle on this...but when he takes charge to give direction he may be stepping on Brice's toes of leadership. Self-awareness will be key in this and he may simply need to ask Brice for direction when he wants it as to not through off group dynamics.#hardworking dude#57#15#UA Reach#Kris Pennington#Brice Milam#Connor Reece#Matthew Cutler#5#William Swartz#x#Stefan Kim#AIME138#
